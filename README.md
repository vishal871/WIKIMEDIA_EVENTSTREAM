# WIKIMEDIA_EVENTSTREAM
The project is designed to stream real-time data from Wikimedia's recent changes stream and send it to a Kafka topic. It utilizes the EventSource class to connect to Wikimedia's live event stream, where the wikimediaproducerchngeseventhandler handles incoming messages. These messages are then sent to a Kafka topic (wikimedia_recent_changes) using a KafkaTemplate. The system processes events in the background while the main application remains responsive, allowing for real-time data processing and messaging. The project includes a 10-second sleep to allow message reception and then gracefully closes the stream connection.
